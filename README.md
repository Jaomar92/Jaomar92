## üöÄ Currently Working On
- Developing a Coding Course: Creating a comprehensive coding course to help others get started with development.
- Building My Own UI Library: Exploring how to create a UI library that‚Äôs lightweight, customizable, and developer-friendly.
- Seeking Front-End Development Opportunities: Looking for my next front-end development job to further grow my skills.
- Blogging and Content Creation: Writing blog posts to share my journey, but a bit hesitant to publish just yet.

## üí° Thoughts & Ideas

üî≠ Create My Own NPM Package: Developing a custom UI library could be the first step.

üå± Sell Website Templates: It would be great to generate passive income by creating reusable website templates.

üöÄ GitHub as a CMS for Blogging: Inspired by others, I‚Äôm curious about using GitHub for managing and hosting blog content.
